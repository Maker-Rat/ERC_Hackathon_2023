# Automation (Perception, Planning and Control)
1) **Planning** : 
   We've implemented RRT and A* path planning algorithms to solve the presented problem. For A* grid generation, we have implemented a hardcoded regular grid as well as a PRM (ProbabIlistic Random Mapping) based approach. Since the given maze
   is relatively rectangular the harcoded grid approach tends to provide the best results. The density of the grid can be altered by modifying a single value in the code.

3) **Control** : 
   After an unsuccessful attempt at implementing PID for the problem, we switched to LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator). This made more sense given the multi-variable control nature of the problem. LQR utilizes a state space model of the
   system where the state matrix consists of the x coordinate, y coordinate and the yaw angle while the control input matrix consists of linear velocity and angular velocity. LQR operates by solving the quadratic Ricatti loss equation for
   stable poles to find the gain matrix K. The controller input is then calculated as (scaled reference) - (K * X), where X is the current state vector.


   As can be observed in the provided video, the robot tries to rigorously follow the path planned and hence can be slow at certain points while trying to calibrate. This can be further improved by fine tuning the Q and R matrices. One more
   interesting approach to tune these matrices could be a learning based approach using RL or deep learning.
    
# Electronics
We have minimised the use of Arduino. The electronics part of our design has mainly 4 sections, we will go though each of them in detail.

Section1: The Sender Coil
We have created a circuit using ic555 that converts a dc 9V to nearly AC signal. And then this signal will be transmitted to the coil which is represented as an Inductor.
Section2: The Logical Processing
We are assuming that as the signals are captured by the receiver coil, it will generate some amount of potential difference big aur small. So, using this principle we can bias diodes as per our requirement. We have used 3 diodes 3 relays and 3 voltage biases for the diodes. The voltage biases can be tuned as per the potential difference generated by receiver coil. These forward biasing of diodes will trigger the relays ending up switching between 4 cases. Wherein the first case has no land mines detected so will have least or no potential difference generated receiver coil. Second case, as land mine is detected>3m the potential difference of receiver coil will increase, biasing the first diode, triggering the first relay which would take it to the second mode. Similarly, as the mine comes closer the potential difference will increase causing more diodes to be biased and more relays to be triggered, leading to switching between different cases.
Section3: Motor Driver
Using L293D ic.
Section4: Seven Segment Display and Buzzer
Implementation of the Seven Segment display and Buzzer using Arduino and resistors of 220 ohms each.
Arduino:
Although we have minimised the use of Arduino, it was required to receive data from ROS (Robotics Operating System). We tried to use ic555 for buzzer, but were unable to crack the given cases.
# Mechanical
This rover is made to remove mines form the ground. It uses a drill which revolves around mine to remove soil around the mine. Then the two arms are sent inside the hole to get under the mine and lift it up. This rover has tracks to move around which work independently for it to make turn. It has long rod extension in front to detect mines inside ground.
